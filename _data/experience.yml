  job_title: Engineering Manager
  dates: July 2016 - June 2018
  description: |
   I managed a high performing team of software engineers that integrated cloud services as part of the Infrastructure monitoring, one of the most critical products of New Relic.

   The Cloud Integrations team was based in Barcelona. It was partly remote and, as part of the Infrastructure initiative based in San Francisco, had to develop methodologies and communication skills to ensure coordination and alignment across teams.

   I was responsible for:
   - Maintaining healthy team dynamics and keeping the team output at high levels of velocity, quality and reliability.
   - Supporting the team and helping them with high-level tech decisions, technical architecture, as well as to raise blockers and needs from the rest of the organization.:- Partnering closely with product management, engineering managers within Infrastructure organization, support team, tech writers and the rest of stakeholders to set up team priorities  and roadmap in order to facilitate project delivery.
   - Hiring and on-boarding top engineering talent.
   I elevated team performance through mentoring and coaching. Attracted and retained software engineers through career path conversations and assigning projects tailored to skill level and interests.

   Finally, I worked with the recruiting team and leadership to create a new team, within the Infrastructure initiative, in charge of creating on-premise integrations. I hired and managed first team members until their new manager got hired and on-boarded.
