## Experience

#### Engineering Manager at New Relic (October 2016 - June 2018)
I managed a high performing team of software engineers that integrated cloud services as part of the Infrastructure monitoring, one of the most critical products of New Relic.

The Cloud Integrations team was based in Barcelona. It was partly remote and, as part of the Infrastructure initiative based in San Francisco, had to develop methodologies and communication skills to ensure coordination and alignment across teams.

I was responsible for:
- Maintaining healthy team dynamics and keeping the team output at high levels of velocity, quality and reliability.
- Supporting the team and helping them with high-level tech decisions, technical architecture, as well as to raise blockers and needs from the rest of the organization.
- Partnering closely with product management, engineering managers within Infrastructure organization, support team, tech writers and the rest of stakeholders to set up team priorities  and roadmap in order to facilitate project delivery.
- Hiring and on-boarding top engineering talent.

I elevated team performance through mentoring and coaching. Attracted and retained software engineers through career path conversations and assigning projects tailored to skill level and interests.

Finally, I worked with the recruiting team and leadership to create a new team, within the Infrastructure initiative, in charge of creating on-premise integrations. I hired and managed first team members until their new manager got hired and on-boarded.

#### Senior Software Engineer at New Relic (October 2014 - October 2016)

I helped New Relic presenting data using beautiful dashboards and charts that users would want to build with.

I was mainly focused on:
- Designing, creating and maintaining the REST APIs. I started using Python and Django-Rest-Framework, then moving to Ruby and Grape.
- Integrating with New Relic's microservices arquitecture: API Gateway, authentication, authorization, Feature Flags....
- The improved dashboarding and charting solutions (ReactJS + D3).

#### Senior Software Engineer at Ducksboard (September 2011 - October 2014)
Ducksboard was a real-time dashboard that helped you visualize and monitor your data in one single place.

Ducksboard was able to access data from 65 applications, including Facebook, GitHub, Google Analytics, New Relic, salesforce.com, Twilio, Mailchimp and Zendesk. Ducksboard enabled users to show data from multiple external applications alongside internal metrics, and to create dashboards and widgets for visualization through simple API calls.

Ducksboard was used by over 700 businesses and their customers created over 50,000 dashboards.

There, I did everything and more:
- I was in charge of the REST API (Python + Django).
- I spent a lot of time working in the frontend (Javascript + Backbone + D3).
- I was also in charge of the integration with the different Stripe billing APIs.
- Of course, I created and maintained several SaaS integrations (Python + Twisted).

Ducksboard was [acquired][2] by New Relic in October 2014.
